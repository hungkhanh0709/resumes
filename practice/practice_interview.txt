Practice Interview Planning with Japanese Teacher
Based on your resume, here's guidance for your practice interview with a Japanese teacher:

1. When to practice and preparation todos
Before scheduling the practice interview, complete these todos:

Review technical Japanese vocabulary related to backend development (Java, Spring Boot, etc.)
Prepare a 2-minute 自己紹介 (self-introduction) in Japanese
Practice explaining your Yahoo! Kids and donation portal projects in Japanese
Prepare answers to common interview questions in Japanese (strengths, weaknesses, why Japan)
Review JLPT N3 grammar patterns commonly used in business settings
Practice formal keigo (敬語) expressions appropriate for interviews
Prepare 3-5 questions to ask the interviewer in Japanese
Study Japanese interview etiquette (proper bowing, business card exchange)
Suggested timing: Schedule after completing at least 80% of the preparation tasks above.

2. Department and job description
For FPT Japan, based on your experience, target these positions:

バックエンドエンジニア (Backend Engineer) - Leveraging your Java/Spring Boot expertise
テクニカルリード (Technical Lead) - Using your team leadership experience
ブリッジSE (Bridge SE) - Capitalizing on your cross-cultural experience with Japanese clients
FPT Japan typically values engineers who can communicate between Japanese clients and Vietnamese development teams - your JLPT N3 and experience with Japanese companies make you a strong candidate.

3. Resume and portfolio
Yes, sending "経歴書_ToHungKhanh_JP_202507.xlsx" is appropriate. This Japanese-format resume is essential for Japanese companies. Additionally:

Create a simple portfolio page highlighting Yahoo! Kids and donation portal projects
Prepare to discuss your contributions to Japanese products in Japanese language
Have 2-3 technical problem examples you solved at Yahoo! projects ready to explain
4. Session duration
Two hours total is ideal:

First hour: Formal interview practice (自己紹介, technical questions, your questions)
Second hour: Feedback session and focused practice on weak areas
Additional recommendations:
Record the practice session for self-review (with permission)
Ask your teacher to use actual technical terms Japanese companies use
Request feedback specifically on your technical vocabulary and keigo usage
Practice the interview bow (お辞儀) and formal sitting posture
